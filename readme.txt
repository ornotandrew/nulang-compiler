This assignment enables the creation of an AST for the mininulang language, and checks this for errors.

Instructions:
	-	Make sure you're using python3
	-	Run "python3 parse.py <nulang file>" to see an output of the AST, or the errors if there are any
	-	Note that there is no errors.py, as parse.py does it's job already
